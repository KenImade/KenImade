I'm a Software Engineer with a strong interest in data engineering, backend systems, and integrating machine learning into real-world applications. I enjoy solving problems at the intersection of data, automation, and infrastructure â€” whether it's building APIs, orchestrating data workflows, or developing systems that improve day-to-day processes.
