# <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> Hi, I'm Kenneth Imade

I'm a Software Engineer with a strong interest in data engineering, backend systems, and integrating machine learning into real-world applications. I enjoy solving problems at the intersection of data, automation, and infrastructure — whether it's building APIs, orchestrating data workflows, or developing systems that improve day-to-day processes.

### 🧠 What I Focus On
- **Backend Engineering** – Building APIs and data-driven applications using Python, Django, FastAPI, and containerized environments.
- **Data Engineering** – Designing automated data pipelines and infrastructure to support scalable analytics and ML workflows.
- **Machine Learning Systems** – Working on the engineering side of ML — from cleaning and prepping data to deploying models into production.
- **Process Automation** – Using code and tooling to reduce manual work and improve accuracy across business workflows.
